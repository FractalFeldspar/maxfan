I worked in a team with around 15 other people to develop a product intended to solve a real user need. Over the semester, we brainstormed ideas, interviewed users, and iterated on prototypes before demonstrating our product in the final presentation.<br></p> <p>The idea we decided on was a device that automatically limits the speed of a wheelchair going down an incline. It also has the secondary purpose of protecting a wheelchair user’s hands since they would normally slide their hands on the hand rims to slow down.</p> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-4 mb-3"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR_npTmWbdI?si=XluR2WQ5EhNNiIaw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>One of the first problems we needed to solve was how to limit the speed of a wheelchair. I experimented with brushless motors whose leads were shorted out. However, I calculated that they wouldn’t provide nearly enough damping for the combined weight of a wheelchair and its user. Moreover, I knew from my interviews with wheelchair users that minimizing weight was a priority, and these motors weren’t particularly light. We also considered other strategies such as centrifugal clutches and shear thickening fluids but determined that they had too many tradeoffs (e.g., high weight, high energy loss when not in use).</p> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-4 mb-3"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOW1X2MwR1U?si=fVqjGhRY_OuEwAtq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>Eventually, we decided that bike brakes were the most practical way to slow the wheelchair down, but it was not clear to us how we would actuate them. In particular, we were unsure whether we wanted to actuate the brakes using an electromechanical solution or a purely mechanical solution. For this reason, we split into two subteams. I joined the mechanical subteam and proposed and prototyped the design shown in the video. The idea I had was to trigger the brake using the wheelchair’s tilt angle instead of the rotational speed of its wheel. In addition, instead of pushing brake pads against a brake disk, I proposed that we keep the brake pads preloaded against the brake disk and allow those brake pads to rotate with the brake disk. To actuate the brake, the device locks the brake pads to the frame of the wheelchair, which forces the brake disk to rub against the brake pads. The prototype in the video operates as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The black component is fixed to the wheelchair's frame.</li> <li>The white sprocket and red brake disk always rotate with the wheelchair wheel.</li> <li>The dark blue component holds a brake pad. When the wheelchair is not braking, the dark blue component and its brake pad rotate with the red brake disk.</li> <li>When the wheelchair tilts forward (such as when going down a ramp), a steel ball inside the black component rolls down and locks the light blue component against the black component.</li> <li>The light blue component rotates with the dark blue component. Therefore, when the ball rolls down, both the light blue component and dark blue component are locked against the black component.</li> <li>If the wheelchair wheel continues to spin, it forces the red brake disk to rub against the brake pad in the dark blue component. This should slow the wheelchair down.</li> </ul> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wheelchair/mechanical_proto_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wheelchair/mechanical_proto_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wheelchair/mechanical_proto_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/wheelchair/mechanical_proto_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="second mechanical prototype" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This CAD screenshot illustrates the inner workings of the mechanism.

This was because it was faster to implement, which was critical under our tight deadlines. Team members were also dissuaded by the fact that our subteam hadn’t tested a mechanical solution on a wheelchair yet. After this project pivot, I worked primarily on creating the animations for the final presentation and the housing of the prototype.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wheelchair/case_top-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wheelchair/case_top-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wheelchair/case_top-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/wheelchair/case_top.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="top view of device housing" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wheelchair/case_bottom-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wheelchair/case_bottom-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wheelchair/case_bottom-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/wheelchair/case_bottom.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="bottom view of device housing" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>After creating multiple CAD mockups of the housing and listening to feedback from my teammates, I surface modeled this shape.

What struck me the most was how much work went into things that no one outside the team would see. I have always seen this in large projects, but it seemed especially true in a large team project like this. My experience with the team also taught me valuable lessons such as how it’s more persuasive to communicate with physical prototypes and test results compared to ideas and CAD.</p> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
