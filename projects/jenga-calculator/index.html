The act of calculation destroys the calculator, so each calculation requires the mechanism to be rebuilt. Rebuilding takes approximately 4 hours due to the need to not only arrange the Jenga blocks but also to carefully test each logic gate. This 4 hour build time resulted in me only building and testing this calculator twice. The video shows the first test of this calculator. It actually glitched near the top-left when one of the logic gates was accidentally activated, but somehow another glitch counteracted that and allowed the calculator to display the correct answer. I tried rebuilding and retesting the calculator, but it glitched again and that time ended up displaying the incorrect answer.</p> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-4 mb-3"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydJ9niocncg?si=VefNMnUHaotYA9tn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>For some context, I started building Jenga structures in 2014 as a hobby. It was a source of continuous amazement to me that I could always find something interesting to build out of such simple building blocks. At first I focused on static structures like towers, bridges, and domes, but I eventually discovered dynamic structures that could transmit signals. As I learned more about these dynamic structures, my curiosity drove me towards more complex projects such as this calculator.</p> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-4 mb-3"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuJCyEyGsk4?si=NDVl-jB59-ky9Q2C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>The calculator relies heavily on a simplified version of the mechanisms in the video above. This mechanism complements dominoes (which I use in the middle and end of the calculator) because unlike dominoes, severing it anywhere along its length causes the mechanism to send a signal instead of prevent a signal. Since I relied more on AND and OR gates than on XOR gates, I ended up using this mechanism far more often than dominoes.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/old_jenga_calculator.JPG" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/old_jenga_calculator.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="old jenga calculator" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As I was prototyping this calculator, I quickly realized that I needed to optimize for compactness and reliability. The prototype in the picture above was only a single bit adder (inputs on the left and output on the right) and it already took up the whole table. Since I had limited space and I wanted to make the design more elegant, I spent a lot of my time optimizing the spatial arrangement of the logic gates and signal paths.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_screenshot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_screenshot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_screenshot-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_screenshot.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="screenshot of my prototype mechanical adder" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_prototype-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_prototype-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_prototype-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/jenga_calculator/dbc_prototype.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="fragment of my prototype mechanical adder" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> The left picture is the CAD of my mechanical adder and the right picture is a fragment of the prototype I built </div> <p>This would be the first ever calculator project I would work on, but it would certainly not be the last. I became intensely curious about mechanical calculators afterwards and would go on to build another binary adder out of K’Nex. A few years later in 2018, I attempted to design a much more powerful calculator (shown in the images above) that would take decimal numbers as inputs, convert them to binary, and then add or subtract those binary numbers. However, after 5 months I halted work on that project. This was partially because I knew I still had many more months of work to do, and I felt an increasing pressure to work on an exciting project that had been on my mind for over a year—the mechanical ball clock. Moreover, I was going through a profound period of transformation in my life and turning to a new project was a symbol of a fresh new start for me.</p> <p>In 2019, I started designing a fully mechanical programmable computer, and that project is still ongoing. In 2025, I would create a functional copy of the historic Curta calculator. Based on the last decade, it seems like no matter what other projects I work on, I always seem to come back to mechanical calculators. I’m not sure why that is, but my best guess is that I enjoy designing and understanding complex mechanical devices, and in my mind there are few mechanical devices more complex than a mechanical calculator.</p> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
