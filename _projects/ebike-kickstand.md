My friend broke his e-bike’s kickstand, so I decided this would be a good opportunity to practice CNC milling and make a new one for him. After 3D modeling the kickstand based on pictures and measurements of the original, I set up the milling toolpaths in Fusion 360 and milled it out of a block of aluminum at one of MIT’s makerspaces.

Assembling my milled aluminum with the rest of the kickstand was surprisingly difficult due to the extremely stiff spring the kickstand used for its bistable positioning. Fortunately, I was able to clamp the aluminum in the mill’s vise and compress the spring by using the mill spindle as an arbor press.
