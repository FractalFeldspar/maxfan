I created artificial Tide Pods as a way to practice designing organic shapes. The colorful chambers were modeled using Fusion 360â€™s form sculpting tools, while the plastic wrapper was designed with surface modeling techniques. I 3D printed the chambers and thermoformed the wrapper using a dental thermoformer, a clear PET sheet, and a custom 3D-printed mold.
