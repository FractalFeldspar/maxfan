One evening, I impulsively decided that I wanted to 3D model a milk jug. As simple as a milk jug might look, creating the handle was surprisingly difficult and I found the experience quite useful for practicing surface modeling techniques.

Once the 3D model was done, I had it metal 3D printed by JLCPCB for around $30. JLCPCB is known for PCB prototyping, but they also offer extremely cheap 3D printingâ€”often less than 1/20th the price of other companies like Protolabs or Xometry. The metal 3D printed milk jug had a very rough surface finish so I tossed it into a magnetic tumbler and finished it off at a buffing wheel. Overall, I think it turned out well. It's very eye-catching and will make a fine addition to my collection of curiosity objects.
