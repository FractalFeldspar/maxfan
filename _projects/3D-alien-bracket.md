I made this bracket while exploring Fusion 360's new “automated modeling” tool. This tool allows you to select surfaces you want to connect and bodies you want to avoid and automatically generate a body that fulfills those requirements. It gives you multiple generated bodies to choose from and they tend to take on organic appearances because they rely on Fusion 360’s form sculpting environment. (The generated bodies can be edited there afterwards.) It’s worth noting that while their “automated modeling” tool bears resemblance to their generative design tool, this tool does not necessarily optimize for strength or weight. For this “bracket,” I asked Fusion 360 to connect the surfaces of 5 random cylinders together. I would actually end up using this tool for one of my “real” projects in the future, the frame of my Nixie tube clock.
