I had an idea to use the properties of rubber to resist backdriving, so I made this proof-of-concept prototype. When the slider on one side is moved back and forth, it easily moves the slider on the other side. However, when the slider on the other side is moved back and forth, it encounters significant resistance. This is because the slider on one side pulls a piece of rubber whenever it is moved while the slider on the other side pushes the rubber whenever it is moved. When rubber is pulled inside of a confined space, its cross sectional area decreases. However, pushing the rubber inside of a confined space increases its cross sectional area and causes it to bind up against the walls. I made the rubber by 3D printing a mold and casting very soft (Shore 10 A) silicone rubber in the mold. Softer silicone deforms more easily and has higher friction with the walls, so this makes the backdrive resistance especially obvious. However, the softness of the silicone also makes it have more “backlash” when the slider on the side that should experience backdrive resistance is moved back and forth.
