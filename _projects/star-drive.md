I came up with a mechanism that converts continuous motion (at the white sliding component) into intermittent motion (at the yellow star). While it functionally resembles a Geneva drive, the method by which it does this is different. This is one of the few mechanisms I know of that uses a star as a functional rather than aesthetic element.
