I started making puzzles because I thought they would make fun gifts for people. I started with this sphere puzzle. To CAD the pieces, I subdivided a sphere into cubes and then manually joined them together into interesting shapes.

This puzzle consists of four interlocked loops of puzzle pieces. This turns the puzzle into a compound puzzle, where the first puzzle is to individually figure out each of the four loops and the second puzzle is to figure out how to disassemble and reassemble those four loops into the final cube shape. The green loop adds more challenge because there is more than one way to create a loop out of its pieces. For fun, I also threw in a single light blue unit cube that goes somewhere inside the final cube.

This puzzle consists of 10 pieces that must be joined into a cube-shaped loop. It's surprisingly difficult since it's hard to know if a given chain of pieces will form a closed loop until there are only a few unconnected pieces left. For fun, I made the solution to this puzzle a trefoil knot (an overhand knot that has its loose ends joined together).
