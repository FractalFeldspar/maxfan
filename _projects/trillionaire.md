I designed this gearbox so that it would take over two trillion turns of the white crank to get the gears back to their starting positions (i.e., they all make an integer number of rotations and revolutions around the mechanism). Each of the colored gears increases the number of combinations by about a factor of 1000. While I designed this purely for fun, one potential application of this mechanism is triggering a hard stop or some other action after a rotary joint makes a specific number of turns. Another application is to use it as an aesthetic display that never repeats itself, similar to a double pendulum or waterfall.
