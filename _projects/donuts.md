I donâ€™t typically show projects where most of the work I did was following instructions or a tutorial, so I will state right now that full credit goes to [this excellent YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haAdmHqGOw), which guided me through how to 3D model, render, and even animate this plate of donuts. 3D modeling in Blender is very different from the 3D modeling I typically use (i.e., Fusion 360, Solidworks, Onshape, OpenSCAD, etc.), so I see Blender as a great opportunity to push the bounds of my current CAD skills.
