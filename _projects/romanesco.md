I've always been fascinated by the different approaches CAD programs take to generate 3D models. As I was exploring the capabilities of OpenSCAD—a coding-based CAD tool—I created this fractal structure using a recursive function and then 3D printed it on an FDM printer. Producing a shape like this would be extremely tedious in traditional parametric CAD programs like Fusion 360 or SolidWorks unless scripted.
