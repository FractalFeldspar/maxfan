My friend and I thought it would be fun to make a plushie that looked like an electrolytic capacitor. We embroidered the face and the “1000 µF” and “50 V” labels and sewed all the other details. We even made sure to keep the capacitor anatomically correct by adding vent marks to the top, putting the black strip on the negative side, and making the positive terminal slightly longer than the negative terminal.
