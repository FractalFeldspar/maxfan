I wanted to do more coding projects so I decided to do something that still seemed tied to mechanical engineering or at least spatial reasoning. This program takes a random 3D point cloud and then generates a polyhedron from it by finding the convex hull of the point cloud. I could have used a convex hull library but, since my goal was to learn rather than build the program as fast as possible, I came up with my own strategy, refined it with information I found online, and wrote the code myself. The program starts with a tetrahedron, figures out what points are on the normal side of each face, and then loops through each face, finding the point that is furthest from each face. I then delete any face that this point can see and generate new faces between this point and the rest of the polyhedron. I repeat this for all faces of the polyhedron until there are no more points to add, and then I export the final polyhedron as an STL file. This allows me to import them into CAD softwares and 3D print them.
