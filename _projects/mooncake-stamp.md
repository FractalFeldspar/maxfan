My friend and I thought it would be cool to make wax stamps from scratch together. After I 3D modeled the mooncake-inspired pattern, we CNC milled the stamp head and CNC lathed the handle out of some brass and aluminum stock we had laying around.

After machining, we polished the stamp head and handle using a combination of wet sanding and polishing paste.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/mooncake_stamp/stamped_wax.jpg" alt="wax stamped with mooncake pattern" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>

We then tested the stamp on some wax. I found out that the best technique was to melt the wax, pour it onto the surface to be stamped, and, critically, wait around 30 seconds before pressing the stamp into the wax. Once the wax cools, the stamp can be removed. Stamping too soon after pouring the wax causes the stamp head to stick too strongly to the wax to remove without tearing pieces of wax off with it.
