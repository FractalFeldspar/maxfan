I thought of a way to produce extremely high gear ratios by taking advantage of the fact that the immediate velocity of a point near where a stationary internal gear and a spur gear mesh is near zero. By stacking a second spur gear on top of the original spur gear and setting their pitch diameters to be very close (but not quite) the same, I can make this second spur gear drive a second internal gear at an extremely low speed. In this proof of concept, I have two stages of this gearbox, each with a reduction ratio of 100:1. Years later, I would find out that this mechanism already exists in a similar form called a "split ring planetary gearbox."

I later found out that someone else had developed a gearbox that used the same operating principle that I used (). I don't think this gearbox design is nearly as well-known as other "exotic" gearboxes like harmonic drives and cycloidal drives, but it is able to achieve a much higher gear ratio for a given bounding box and minimum tooth thickness. 

Original gearbox was 20 mm tall and had a 33 mm outer diameter (including the gearbox casing) and had a 13,225:1 gear ratio

With optimization, a single stage that only uses gears with around 30 teeth each can probably surpass a 1000:1 gear ratio.
