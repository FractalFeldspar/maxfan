As part of a high school humanities project, I made an architectural model of a hypothetical high schoolâ€™s auditorium. I gave it prominent arches on either side because they superficially resembled a pair of ears and they made the building visually interesting. I also made the roof a ruled surface to facilitate construction and angled it so that rainwater and dirt are funneled towards the trees in the front rather than stagnating on the roof.
